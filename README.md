# E-FierteCraft

# Why ?

I wanted to create a good plugin with basic functionalities that will work with every modern survival small server, and I and I found this exercise very fun so I pushed it as far as possible. The objective was to make the project as stable as possible for functionalities that were not very complex to create.

# How ?

First, you will need to create a file **"config.yml"** with this inside :

```yml
discord_token: ""
channel_verification: ""
channel_link: ""
```

It will be used for, discord connection, detect verification channel and link channel.
